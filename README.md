# Elk community plugins pack

This is a meta-repository containing as submodules the projects for various plugins built for [Elk Audio OS on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/elk-audio/).

Whenever a modification of the original project was needed for the build, the submodules point to local forks hosted on [this Github organization](https://github.com/elk-community).

Under the release section, you will an archive with all the plugins with a directory hierarchy (`elk-plugins-pack.tar.xz`). Extract it under e.g. `/udata/plugins/` to have all the plugins available on the board.

## Plugin status

Not all of the plugins have been thouroughly tested; the focus was getting them to build and run without Xenomai Real-Time issues.

Please report any that is not working by submitting an Issue here or, the other way around, we are looking into preparing a selection of plugins that are both high quality and work nicely with Elk - for recommendations about good candidates, feel free to post in the relative section on our forum:
