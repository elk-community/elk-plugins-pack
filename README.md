# Elk community plugins pack

This is a meta-repository containing as submodules the projects for various plugins built for [Elk Audio OS on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/elk-audio/).

Whenever a modification of the original project was needed for the build, the submodules point to local forks hosted on [this Github organization](https://github.com/elk-community).

Under the release section, you will find separate zipped binaries for each sub-project and an archive with all the plugins with a directory hierarchy (`elk-plugins-pack.tar.xz`).
